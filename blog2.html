    <br>
    <h2 class="flex justify-center items-center text-black text-4xl font-bold py-2 tracking-wide">Lessons from the Kitchen, Served Warm</h2>
    <p class="text-black text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 px-8">I didn't fall in love with cooking because I was good at it - I fell in love because it taught me things life never could say out loud.</p>
    <p class="text-black text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 px-8">At first, cooking felt like chaos: measuring, chopping, burning things I swore I was watching. But slowly, something shifted. I started noticing the silence between the sizzles, the rhythm in the stirring, the calm in the repetition. Cooking, I realized, had its own kind of wisdom - quiet, honest, and always hands-on.</p>
    <p class="text-black text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 px-8">It taught me <b>patience.</b> Not everything can be rushed - not a stew, not healing, not growth. Some things need time to simmer to be truly good.</p>
    <p class="text-black text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 px-8">It taught me <b>adaptability.</b> Missing an ingredient? Make a swap. Recipe gone wrong? Start over. Life's like that too - rarely perfect, but always giving you a chance to improvise.</p>
    <p class="text-black text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 px-8">It taught me <b>presence.</b> You can't be fully distracted when you're in the kitchen. A moment too long and the garlic burns. A second of mindfulness, and suddenly you're tasting something better than expected. Cooking reminded me to be where my hands are - to live in the new now.</p>
    <p class="text-black text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 px-8">And most of all, it taught me that <b>effort is love.</b> There's something beautiful about creating something from scratch, not for praise, but because you care. Whether it's a bowl of soup or a gesture of kindness - the intention behind it matters more than perfection.</p>
    <p class="text-black text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 px-8">Cooking became my quiet therapy, my creative outlet, my reminder that I could nourish myself and others - even when life felt uncertain.</p>
    <p class="text-black text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 px-8">So no, I don't always follow the rules. Sometimes I burn the toast. But every time I stand over a pot or roll dough between my fingers, I remember:life, like cooking, isn't about getting it perfect - it's about showing up, trying again, and finding joy in the making.</p>
