    <h1 class="flex justify-center items-center text-white text-7xl font-bold mt-2">THE DISH THAT RAISED ME!</h1>
    <br>
    <h2 class="flex justify-center items-center text-white text-4xl font-bold py-2 tracking-wide">Amala, Ewedu, and My Mother's Hands</h2>
    <p class="text-white text-lg font-normal mt-4 mb-2 px-8">If home had a flavor, mine would taste like Amala. Ewedu soup, and tender meat - soft, rich, and deeply familiar. It wasn't just a meal. It was a tradition, a rhythm, a language spoken between my mother and me long before I understood the power of food.</p>
    <p class="text-white text-lg font-normal mt-4 mb-2 px-8">Every Saturday morning, like clockwork, the smell would begin to creep through the house. The earthy scent of yam flour slowly whisked into a dark, steamy swirl - Amala, always smooth, never lumpy. Then came the green - the Ewedu leaves, beaten to a velvet consistency, laced with locust beans and a hint of magic I still can't replicate.</p>
    <p class="text-white text-lg font-normal mt-4 mb-2 px-8">And finally, the meat. Oh, the meat. Soft, seasoned to the bone, simmered until it fell apart under the weight of my fork - or, more often, my eager fingers.</p>
    <p class="text-white text-lg font-normal mt-4 mb-2 px-8">I'd hover nearby as my mum moved effortlessly between pots, no recipe in sight, just inict, memory, and love. She cooked like she was telling a story - of where we came from, of who we were. In the moments between her stirring and seasoning, I learned more than cooking: I learned care, pride, and patience.</p>
    <p class="text-white text-lg font-normal mt-4 mb-2 px-8">Sitting down to eat, we didn't talk much. We didn't need to. Every swallow of Amala coated in green Ewedu, soaked in spicy stew, said enough. It said <b>welcome.</b> It said <b>home.</b></p>
    <p class="text-white text-lg font-normal mt-4 mb-2 px-8">To this day, no matter where I find myself, Amala and Ewedu is more than a dish - it's a piece of my mother's heart, a memory I can taste, and a reminder that "the food that raises you never really leaves you."</p>
